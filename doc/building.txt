This document explains how to build Trencher.

Obtaining the Source Code
=========================

Trencher's source code can be obtained from the tool's web page:

    * Trencher <http://concurrency.cs.uni-kl.de/trencher.html>

Prerequisites
=============

Trencher is written in C++. The following compilers are known to be
capable of building it:

    * GCC >= 4.7 <http://gcc.gnu.org/>
    * Clang >= 3.1 <http://llvm.clang.org>
    * MinGW GCC >= 4.7 <http://mingw.org/> (do install the `C++
      Compiler' option)

The following software must be installed before Trencher can be built:

    * CMake >= 2.8 <http://cmake.org/>
    * Boost >= 1.46 <http://www.boost.org/> (headers and the following
      libraries: chrono, filesystem, system, thread).

Building on UNIX & MacOS
========================

The simplest way to compile Trencher on UNIX is:

    1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.

    2. Type `make' to configure and build the package. The package will
       be built in the subdirectory called `build'.

Note that you will need a make utility installed (one is usually a
recommended dependency of CMake).
On MacOS boost is installed via "brew install boost --with-c++11".


Building on Windows
===================

    1. Run `cmake-gui'. Specify source and build directories, paths to
       the libraries, choose a compiler.

    2. Run `cmake --build <selected build directory>'. The package will
       be built in the specified directory.
